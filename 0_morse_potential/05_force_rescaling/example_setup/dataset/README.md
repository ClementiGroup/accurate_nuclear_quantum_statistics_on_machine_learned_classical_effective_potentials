# Generating the dataset by recycling PIMD data

`config.yaml` contains parameters of the dataset recycling. First, the location of the folder with source PIMD files (`source_location`), the name of the folder itself (`input_folder_name`) need to be specified. 
Then, temperature (K) and particle mass (a.u.) used to generate the original data (`T_0` and `mass_0`) need to be adjusted. Finally, the desired temperature and mass need to be given (`T_1` and `mass_1`).

Masses for different isotop composition (Corresponding to O-H, O-D and O-T bonds):

| composition | mass (a.u.)|
|-------------|------------|
|   O - H     |  1728.3071 |
|-------------|------------|
